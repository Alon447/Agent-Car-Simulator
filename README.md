## Overview

The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning of Traffic Routing project is a simulation-based approach to study and optimize traffic flow in networks of autonomous vehicles using multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. The project aims to model and simulate real-world traffic scenarios and enable autonomous vehicles to learn optimal routing strategies to navigate efficiently.

## Features

- **Traffic Flow Simulation:** Simulate traffic behavior based on various road parameters, weather conditions, and car characteristics.
- **Visual Representation:** Visualize the simulation results with 2D maps, heatmaps, and animations.
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning:** Apply reinforcement learning algorithms to autonomous vehicles to learn optimal path-finding strategies.
- **Graph Transformation:** Transform real-life maps into graph structures for simulation and analysis.
