    CarManager class:
    This class manages cars within a road network simulation. It adds, removes, and updates cars during the simulation.

    Attributes:

    cars_waiting_to_enter (list): List of cars waiting to enter the simulation.

    cars_in_simulation (dict): Dictionary of cars currently in the simulation.

    cars_nearest_update (list): List of cars that determine the time of the next update.

    cars_nearest_update_time (int): Time of the next update.

    cars_blocked (list): List of cars blocked in the simulation.

    cars_finished (list): List of cars that have finished their journey.

    cars_stuck (list): List of cars stuck at the end of the simulation.

    simulation_update_times (dict): Dictionary of cars that have been updated in the current time step.

    Methods:

    add_update_to_dictionary(self, time, car_id, x, y, node_id): Add car update information to the dictionary.

    add_car(self, car, time): Add a car to the simulation.

    sort_cars_in_simulation(self): Sort cars in the simulation based on the time until the next road.
